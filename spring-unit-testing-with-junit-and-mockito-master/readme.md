# Unit Testing with Spring, JUnit and Mockito

## Learn Unit Testing with most popular frameworks - Spring Boot, JUnit and Mockito

Spring Boot is the most popular framework to develop RESTful Services. It has awesome unit testing capabilities through Spring Boot Starter Test. Mockito is the most popular mocking framework. JUnit is most popular Java Unit Testing Framework.

In this course, you will learn to build unit tests for simple RESTful Services with Spring Boot Starter Test, Mockito and JUnit. You will learn to write independent unit tests for RESTful web services talking with multiple layers - web, business and data. You will learn how to write integration tests using an in memory database H2.

You will build the unit tests step by step - in more than 50 steps. This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to unit testing with Spring Boot and Mockito Frameworks.

You will be using Spring (Dependency Management), Spring Boot, Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE), in memory database H2 and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.

You will use all the frameworks that are part of Spring Boot Starter Test - JUnit, Spring Test, Spring Boot Test, AssertJ, Hamcrest, Mockito, JSONassert and JsonPath.

You will learn to use the most important Unit Testing Annotations - @RunWith(SpringRunner.class), @SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest and @MockBean.
