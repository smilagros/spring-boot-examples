# Test Spring Boot Apps with JUnit 5

This example shows how to test your Spring Boot apps with JUnit 5. Please read [Test Your Spring Boot Applications with JUnit 5](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/03/28/test-java-spring-boot-junit5) to see how this example was created.

**Prerequisites:** [Java 8, 11, or 12](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

> [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/) has Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta's intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.

## Getting Started

To install this example, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-junit5-example.git
cd okta-spring-boot-junit5-example
```

### Create an Application in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account (or [sign up](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) if you donâ€™t have an account).

1. From the **Applications** page, choose **Add Application**.
2. On the Create New Application page, select **Web**.
3. Give your app a memorable name, then click **Done**.

Copy your issuer (found under **API** > **Authorization Servers**), client ID, and client secret into `src/main/resources/application.properties` as follows:

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret}
okta.oauth2.scope=openid
```

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

After modifying this file, your app will be setup as an OAuth 2.0 resource server, protected by Okta.
